[2024-04-18 10:29:07.875] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2,946 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2024-04-18 10:29:07.878] [jointLog] [warning] 0.276049% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
