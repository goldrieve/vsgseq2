[2024-04-18 10:29:08.312] [jointLog] [info] Counted 9,149 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2024-04-18 10:29:08.316] [jointLog] [warning] 0.150421% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 26.
