[2024-04-18 10:29:07.672] [jointLog] [info] Counted 6,958 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2024-04-18 10:29:07.680] [jointLog] [warning] 0.296393% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
