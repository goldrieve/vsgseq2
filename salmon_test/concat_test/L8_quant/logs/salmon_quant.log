[2024-04-18 09:22:29.895] [jointLog] [info] Counted 2,045 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2024-04-18 09:22:29.901] [jointLog] [warning] 0.28% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
