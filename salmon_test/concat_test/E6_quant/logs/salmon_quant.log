[2024-04-18 09:22:20.462] [jointLog] [info] Counted 7,596 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2024-04-18 09:22:20.468] [jointLog] [warning] 0.36% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
