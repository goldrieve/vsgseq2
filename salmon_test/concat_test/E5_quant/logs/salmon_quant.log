[2024-04-18 09:22:19.565] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4,587 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2024-04-18 09:22:19.569] [jointLog] [warning] 0.38% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
