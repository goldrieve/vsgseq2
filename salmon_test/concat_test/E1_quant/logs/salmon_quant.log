[2024-04-18 09:22:15.847] [jointLog] [info] Computed 165 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2024-04-18 09:22:15.847] [jointLog] [info] Counted 7,094 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2024-04-18 09:22:15.852] [jointLog] [warning] 0.495% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
