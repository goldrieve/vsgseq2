[2024-04-17 13:08:35.357] [jointLog] [info] Counted 7,990 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2024-04-17 13:08:35.360] [jointLog] [warning] 0.210843% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
