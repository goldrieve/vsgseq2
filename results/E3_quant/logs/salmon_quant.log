[2024-04-17 13:08:35.370] [jointLog] [info] Counted 6,919 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2024-04-17 13:08:35.374] [jointLog] [warning] 0.205813% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
