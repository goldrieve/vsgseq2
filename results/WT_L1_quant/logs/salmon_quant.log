[2024-04-17 13:08:35.409] [jointLog] [info] Counted 4,637 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2024-04-17 13:08:35.413] [jointLog] [warning] 0.180551% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 25.
